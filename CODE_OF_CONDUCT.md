# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, pledge to make participation in our
group a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy environment.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior contributing to a positive environment for our
group include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
group

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

All group members are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Group members have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all group spaces, and also applies
when an individual is officially representing the group in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or other acts of unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project TA. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.

All group members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Group members will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the group.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from group members, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. An apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. This will be 
reported to the group TA and/or the DSCI 310 professor and a discussion will need to
take place. 

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of group standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from the group for a specified period of time. 
No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent removal from group.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
