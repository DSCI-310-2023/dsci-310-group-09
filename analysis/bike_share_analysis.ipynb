    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Bike sharing in Seoul, Korea was founded in 2015 and has grown to become the city’s most popular form of public transportation, gaining over 100 million users in 6 and a half years. It became popular as many citizens favored traveling shorter distances by bike rather than taking crowded transit. Amidst the pandemic, users skyrocketed as many people found it a useful means of transportation to avoid crowded public transit (Joo-Heon, 2022). While this played a factor in an increase in users, there are still other factors that come into play that determine whether citizens are willing to use bikes as a mode of transportation. The question we will be trying to answer with our project is: In 2018, in Seoul, Korea, what were the strongest environmental predictors of the quantity of bikes rented out each day, and how effectively can those predictors be used to predict the number of bikes rented out in a given day given the environmental conditions of that day?  Our dataset contains information on the weather and environmental factors of each hour of each day during 2018. The observations in the data set report on temperature, humidity, windspeed, visibility, dewpoint, solar radiation, snowfall, and rainfall. The dataset also includes observations relating to whether the bike rental facility was functional during that particular day, as well as whether the given day was a holiday."

    "From Figure 3, we note that temperature, solar radiation, and dew point temperature have the strongest correlation with bikes rented per day by a large margin. However, we also notice that temperature and dew point temperature are very strongly correlated to each other (as found using the `ggpairs` function), with a correlation coefficient of 0.966, so including both factors would likely give twice the priority to the temperature that day. Additionally, the correlation coefficient for dew point and bike count is less than 0.7, so it is not a very strong correlation. Therefore, we determine that it would be most appropriate to simply include only temperature and solar radiation as the predictors, since both of their correlation coefficients are above 0.7. \n",

    "The question we were trying to answer was: in 2018, in Seoul, Korea, what were the strongest environmental predictors of the quantity of bikes rented out each day, and how effectively can those predictors be used to predict the number of bikes rented out on a given day given the environmental conditions of that day? We narrowed down the data to use the two predictors with the strongest correlation coefficients, temperature and solar radiation, which had correlation coefficients of 0.764 and 0.750, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the $RMSPE$ values for both K-NN regression and linear regression were lowest when we used both solar radiation and temperature as predictors. We also found that the K-NN regression models have lower $RMSPE$ values than that of linear regression, so the models that used K-NN regression were more accurate. We can therefore conclude that the K-NN regression model with two predictors (temperature and solar radiation) with 9 neighbours is the best model, since it is most accurate with the lowest $RMSPE$ (3782). This means that when given the temperature and solar radiation of a given day, the predicted number of bikes rented  will differ from the actual value by an average of 3782 bikes. This shows that the prediction model is fairly accurate because when we look at the range of bike counts (~35,000) as shown in Figure 1, 3782 is not that significant.  \n",
    "\n",
    "According to a number of articles on biking in South Korea, it was found that cycling is a very common mode of transportation and that Korea is one of the best places to bike. Hall states that \"at any time of year, South Korea is an ideal country to explore by bike\" (2022). For these reasons, we expected harsh weather conditions such as snowfall and rainfall to not contain very strong correlations and according to the bar graph created, they both had fairly weak correlations below 0.3. However, values like temperature and solar radiation influence bike rentals. Temperature was expected, but not solar radiation. According to Jensen, \"... it's cold enough to be dangerous or unpleasant if you're not prepared,\" (2022). Cold weather is one of the only deterrents in Seoul, Korea, because it can be dangerous to bike without the proper equipment. We can predict that people would opt for other transportation options when the temperature drops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings demonstrate that people are more likely to ride bikes in warmer temperatures and when there is higher solar radiation. This information is useful to bike sharing companies because they can offer discounts during times when bike rentals are low (such as colder temperatures and non sunny days), in order to increase users and increase profits. Additionally, these findings demonstrate that bike rental businesses tend to do well in Seoul because harsh/extreme changes in precipitation don’t have much of an effect on customer usage. Therefore, this information could be useful for investors or people who would like to open a new bike rental company because Seoul is a place that could potentially be very successful. These findings could also pose questions about reduced carbon footprint for Korea in the future, since weather doesn't deter people from biking. In addition, it could be useful to study the environmental and social impacts of bike sharing in Korea. Our findings lead to further inquiries, including whether there are impacts/rises in life expectancy as people use bikes more and whether people become less stressed due to constant exposure to the positive and healthy effects that come from bike riding in Seoul."
