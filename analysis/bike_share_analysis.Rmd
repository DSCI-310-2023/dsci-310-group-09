# Introduction

Bike sharing in Seoul, Korea was founded in 2015 and has grown to become the city’s most popular form of public transportation, gaining over 100 million users in 6 and a half years. It became popular as many citizens favored traveling shorter distances by bike rather than taking crowded transit. Amidst the pandemic, users skyrocketed as many people found it a useful means of transportation to avoid crowded public transit [@ajudaily]. While this played a factor in an increase in users, there are still other factors that come into play that determine whether citizens are willing to use bikes as a mode of transportation. The question we will be trying to answer with our project is: In 2018, in Seoul, Korea, what were the strongest environmental predictors of the quantity of bikes rented out each day, and how effectively can those predictors be used to predict the number of bikes rented out in a given day given the environmental conditions of that day? Our dataset [@dataset] contains information on the weather and environmental factors of each hour of each day during 2018. The observations in the data set report on temperature, humidity, windspeed, visibility, dewpoint, solar radiation, snowfall, and rainfall. The dataset [@dataset] also includes observations relating to whether the bike rental facility was functional during that particular day, and whether the given day was a holiday.

# Methods & Results

```

```{r bike-data-table, out.wdith="75%", out.height="75%"}
knitr::kable(head(bike_data), caption = "Original Bike Data")
```

Table \@ref(tab:bike-data-table) presents the original bike share data from the internet, which includes all of the variables and their units.

Next, we wrangle our data into tidy format and group the number of rented bikes by day. This produces a table of our clean data which includes the 8 different environmental factors that we wish to explore.

```{r bike-data-clean-table}
knitr::kable(head(bike_data_clean), caption = "Clean Bike Data")
```

Table \@ref(tab:bike-data-clean-table) presents the data in tidy format. The data has been wrangled to group by day instead of by hour.

To further explore our data, we examine the distribution of rented bikes per day with a histogram.

```{r bike-hist, fig.cap="Histogram of rented bikes per day", out.width="60%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output/bike_histogram.png"))
```


The distribution in Figure \@ref(fig:bike-hist) shows that the number of rented bikes per day takes on a bimodal shape with two peaks. The distribution ranges from `r format(bike_count_min, scientific=FALSE)` to `r format(bike_count_max, scientific=FALSE)` bikes rented, with a mean of `r format(bike_count_mean, scientific=FALSE)` bikes rented per day.

After splitting our data into a training set (70%) and testing set, we assess the correlation between the amount of bikes rented and of the environmental/weather predictors.

```{r bike-ggpairs, fig.cap="Scatter plots of all variables plotted against each other and their correlation coefficients", out.width="60%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output/bike_correlations_ggpairs.png"))
```

We can visualize which environmental factors correlate best with bikes rented per day with a bar graph.

```{r bike-cor, fig.cap="Strength of correlation between bike count and environmental factors", out.width="60%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output/bike_count_barplot.png"))
```

From Figure \@ref(fig:bike-cor), we note that temperature, solar radiation, and dew point temperature have the strongest correlation with bikes rented per day by a large margin. However, we also notice that temperature and dew point temperature are very strongly correlated to each other as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:bike-ggpairs), with a correlation coefficient of 0.966, so including both factors would likely give twice the priority to the temperature that day. Additionally, the correlation coefficient for dew point and bike count is less than 0.7, so it is not a very strong correlation. Therefore, we determine that it would be most appropriate to simply include only temperature and solar radiation as the predictors, since both of their correlation coefficients are above 0.7.

Now that we have identified the environmental factors that have the greatest correlation with bike count, we can begin to construct our models. We want to compare linear regression and K-NN regression models to guage which model is most accurate. We will begin with linear regression.

For our first linear regression model, we use temperature as the sole predictor. We find that the RMSE value, which is the root mean squared error for the training data, is `r format(round(lm_rmse_1,2))`. The RMSPE value, which is the root mean squared prediction error for the testing data, is `r format(round(lm_rmspe_1,2))`. This tells us that the average error of our model when predicting the number of bikes per day based on temperature is around 6819. To better understand the model, we plot the data as a scatter plot with the best fit line. The equation for the line of best fit is $y = 9293.4 + 642.6x_1$, where $y$ = number of bikes rented per day, and $x_1$ = temperature (°C).

```{r lm-plot-1, fig.cap="Linear regression model with temperature as predictor", out.width="60%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output/lm_bike_count_temp.png"))
```

The next linear regression model uses solar radiation as the sole predictor. This leads to an RMSE value of `r format(round(lm_rmse_2,2))` and an RMSPE value of `r format(round(lm_rmspe_2,2))`. The equation for the best fit line is $y = 4602 + 23038x_1$ where $y =$ number of bikes rented per day, and $x_1 =$ solar radiation $(MJ/m^2)$.

```{r lm-plot-2, fig.cap="Linear regression model with solar radiation as predictor", out.width="60%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output/lm_bike_count_solar_rad.png"))
```

We can take note that the RMSPE value for the model that uses solar radiation as the predictor (`r format(round(lm_rmspe_2,2))`) was higher than that of the model that uses temperature as the predictor (`r format(round(lm_rmspe_1,2))`). This makes the model using temperature as the predictor an overall a better model than that of solely the solar radiation. 

The final linear regression model uses both environmental factors (temperature and solar radiation) as predictors. We find the RMSE value to be `r format(round(lm_rmse_3,2))` and the RMSPE value to be `r format(round(lm_rmspe_3,2))`. The equation for the line of best fit is $y = 3985.3 + 422.8x_1 + 14480.5x_2$ where:

* $y =$ number of bikes rented per day
* $x_1 =$ temperature (°C)
* $x_2 =$ solar radiation $(MJ/m^2)$

When comparing the 3 different linear regression models, we notice that the RMSPE value for the model with both predictors is lower than the models that use only one predictor. Therefore, the model that uses both predictors is a better model to predict the number of bikes rented per day.

Moving on to K Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) regression, we first build a model that uses uses only temperature as the predictor. We find that using `r k_min_1` neighbors results in the lowest RMSE value of `r format(round(knn_rmse_1,2))`. With a model that uses `r k_min_1` neighbors, we find that the RMSPE value is `r format(round(knn_rmspe_1,2))`. Below, is a scatter plot to better visualize the relation between bike count and temperature with our best neighbors value. It includes the predicted curve as shown in blue. 

```{r knn-plot-1, fig.cap="K-NN regression model with temperature as predictor", out.width="60%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output/knn_bike_count_temp.png"))
```

Our next K-NN model uses solar radiation as the sole predictor. We find that `r k_min_2` neighbours results in the lowest RMSE value of `r format(round(knn_rmse_2,2))`. Building a model with `r k_min_2` neighbours leads to an RMSPE value of `r format(round(knn_rmspe_2,2))`. Both the RMSE and RMSPE values are greater than the error values when using temperature as the predictor. This demonstrates that similar to our linear regression analysis, the K-NN regression model that uses temperature as the only predictor is again more accurate than the model that uses solar radiation when estimating the number of bikes rented per day.

Below is scatter plot that shows the rented bike count vs solar radiation with our predicted model curve (shown in blue).

```{r knn-plot-2, fig.cap="K-NN regression model with solar radiation as predictor", out.width="60%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output/knn_bike_count_solar_rad.png"))
```

Finally, we build a K-NN model that uses both temperature and solar radiation as predictors. We find that using `r k_min_3` results in the lowest RMSE value of `r format(round(knn_rmse_3,2))`. This leads to an RMSPE value of `r format(round(knn_rmspe_3,2))`. These are the lowest error values out of the three K-NN models.

# Discussion

The question we were trying to answer was: in 2018, in Seoul, Korea, what were the strongest environmental predictors of the quantity of bikes rented out each day, and how effectively can those predictors be used to predict the number of bikes rented out on a given day given the environmental conditions of that day? We narrowed down the data to use the two predictors with the strongest correlation coefficients, temperature and solar radiation, which had correlation coefficients of 0.764 and 0.750, respectively.

Overall, the RMSPE values for both K nearest neighbours regression and linear regression were lowest when we used both solar radiation and temperature as predictors. We also found that the K-NN regression models have lower RMSPE values than that of linear regression, so the models that used K-NN regression were more accurate. We can therefore conclude that the K-NN regression model with two predictors (temperature and solar radiation) with `r k_min_3` neighbours is the best model, since it is most accurate with the lowest RMSPE (`r format(round(knn_rmspe_3,2))`). This means that when given the temperature and solar radiation of a given day, the predicted number of bikes rented will differ from the actual value by an average of `r format(round(knn_rmspe_3,0))` bikes. This shows that the prediction model is fairly accurate because the mean number of bikes rented daily is `r format(bike_count_mean, scientific=FALSE)`, so an error of `r format(round(knn_rmspe_3,0))` is not that significant.

According to a number of articles on biking in South Korea, it was found that cycling is a very common mode of transportation and that Korea is one of the best places to bike. Hall states that "at any time of year, South Korea is an ideal country to explore by bike" [@koreanrooftop]. For these reasons, we expected harsh weather conditions such as snowfall and rainfall to not contain very strong correlations and according to the bar graph created, they both had fairly weak correlations below 0.3. However, values like temperature and solar radiation influence bike rentals. Temperature was expected, but not solar radiation. According to Jensen, "... it's cold enough to be dangerous or unpleasant if you're not prepared," [@bookmundi]. Cold weather is one of the only deterrents in Seoul, Korea, because it can be dangerous to bike without the proper equipment. We can predict that people would opt for other transportation options when the temperature drops.

Our findings demonstrate that people are more likely to ride bikes in warmer temperatures and when there is higher solar radiation. This information is useful to bike sharing companies because they can offer discounts during times when bike rentals are low (such as colder temperatures and non sunny days), in order to increase users and increase profits. Additionally, these findings demonstrate that bike rental businesses tend to do well in Seoul because harsh/extreme changes in precipitation don’t have much of an effect on customer usage. Therefore, this information could be useful for investors or people who would like to open a new bike rental company because Seoul is a place that could potentially be very successful. These findings could also pose questions about reduced carbon footprint for Korea in the future, since weather doesn't deter people from biking. In addition, it could be useful to study the environmental and social impacts of bike sharing in Korea. Our findings lead to further inquiries, including whether there are impacts/rises in life expectancy as people use bikes more and whether people become less stressed due to constant exposure to the positive and healthy effects that come from bike riding in Seoul.
