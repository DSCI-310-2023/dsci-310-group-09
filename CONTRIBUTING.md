# Contributing to the DSCI 310 Project

Thank you for contributing to our project! 

This document outlines how to propose a change to the DSCI 310 project. 

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

*  YES: you edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.
*  NO: you edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If you've found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex). Additionally, inform the team if you are facing issues or a bug
with GitHub since someone in the team might know how to fix it or have experienced it before. Lastly, make sure to leave meaningful commit messages when making changes and communicate through GitHub issues. 

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org) or PEP8 [style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
